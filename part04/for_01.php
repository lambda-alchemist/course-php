	"The valley, that had pierc'd my heart with dread,",
	"I look'd aloft, and saw his shoulders broad",
	"Already vested with that planet's beam,",
	"Who leads all wanderers safe through every way.",
	
	"Then was a little respite to the fear,",
	"That in my heart's recesses deep had lain,",
	"All of that night, so pitifully pass'd:",

	"Forespent with toiling, 'scap'd from sea to shore,",
	"Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands",
	"At gaze; e'en so my spirit, that yet fail'd",
	"Struggling with terror, turn'd to view the straits,",
	"That none hath pass'd and liv'd.  My weary frame",
	"After short pause recomforted, again",
	"I journey'd on over that lonely steep,", );
